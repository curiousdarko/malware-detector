# malware-detector

A set of python tools to analyse files using psutil, winreg, logging and more.
# Basic Logging
logging.py is a basis for logging actions.
# File system logging
linux-filesystem-access.py and python-file-system-access.py monitor tampering with files (linux only works with linux, python works with both.)
# Process Connections
processconnections.py prints out details of every connection made by a specific PID.
# Malicious Detector
maliciousdetector.py is a AIO (All in One) tool that DOESN'T run the file, instead analyses metadata and imports to detect malicious activities.
To run maliciousdetector.py, cd into it's directory and type:
```
python maliciousdetector.py C:/WhateverDirectory/SUSFILES/malware.exe
```
